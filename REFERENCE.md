# ZUS Slimpossible Challenge 2026 — Source Reference

Distilled from the official PDF (`ZUS Slimpossible Challenge 2026.pdf`, 16 pp) and the
Google Sheet tracker. **This file is the source of truth for `src/data.js`.** Read this
instead of re-parsing the PDF/sheet. Last cross-checked: 2026-06-22 — `data.js` fully matches.

- Sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EJsSEJlTFtIZPupKgwq07I76MgpqXdylr9xv3JRoivI/edit
- The point-allocation tables in the PDF are **images** (pages 5–6); they do NOT extract via
  `pdftotext`. Render with `pdftoppm -png -r 200 -f 5 -l 6 <pdf> out` and read the PNGs.
- **Prettier reformats `src/*` on save** (4-space indent, double quotes, expanded objects). It
  does NOT drop fields — earlier "reverts" were actually a stale dev server / browser cache on
  the wrong port. Edits made then formatted are fine; just hard-refresh the right port to verify.

## Day-by-day plan (`DAY_PLAN` in data.js)
The Google Sheet is a 14-week × 7-day (Mon–Sun) grid + Booster column — a daily playbook,
complementary to the app's points reference. The app surfaces the plan as an **expandable row inside the booster table**: click any week
row to toggle its 7-day plan (one open at a time); the current week auto-opens and the page
auto-scrolls to it on load. The day split is a **suggested
template, NOT mandated by ZUS**: Mon = reporting/weigh-in, Tue/Thu/Sat = Workout 1/2/3,
Wed/Fri = booster (for boosters that aren't a workout), Sun = rest. `{b}` in a label is
replaced with the week's booster name at render.

## Challenge frame
- 14 weeks, **22 Jun – 27 Sep 2026**. W1 Monday = 22 Jun. Weeks are exactly 7 days.
- **Final Report: 28 Sep** (sheet only; the day after W14 ends).
- Early-registration merch bonus if registered by 30 June.
- All activities **outside working hours**. Only weight *losses* score (maintain/gain = 0).
- All submissions go to the **Lark Base Tracker** — mandatory for any points.

## Weekly recurring points (every week W1–W14)

### Weigh-in — cap 40/wk
Every Monday. Photo/video of scale (feet + display visible). Only losses score.
| Tier | Points |
|------|--------|
| Lose > 0.5 kg | 10 |
| Lose > 1 kg | 40 |

### Step count — cap 100/wk
Log once weekly. Screenshot of any step app (Google Fit, Fitbit, Apple Health, Strava…).
| Weekly steps | Points |
|------|--------|
| 20,000 | 20 |
| 25,000 | 25 |
| 30,000 | 30 |
| 35,000 | 35 |
| > 40,000 | 100 |

### Workouts — cap 100/wk
On separate days (cannot do all 3 in one day). Photo/video showing your face.
| No. of workouts | Points |
|------|--------|
| 1 | 30 |
| 2 | 60 |
| > 3 (i.e. 3+) | 100 |

**Realistic weekly benchmark (`WEEK_MAX`) = 240 pts** = 100 steps + 100 workouts + 40 booster.
Weigh-in (max 40) is **excluded** from the ceiling — the >1 kg/40-pt tier can't be banked
every week. Bi-weekly max (`BIWEEKLY_MAX`) = 480. Cumulative over 14 weeks = 3,360.

## Bi-weekly boosters (30 pts Lark Base required; +10 = 40 pts with ZUS Moments post)

All posts also tag **#ChampionsFuelChampions**. Rule: max 1 submission/week, max 2 per pair.

| Wk | Dates | Booster | Hashtag | Notes |

Booster bonus tips live in a dedicated `bonus` field on the **first week of each pair**
(surfaced from the start of the phase, rendered bold).

**Quantified point tiers: 30 (Lark Base) and 40 (Lark + ZUS Moments).** The +10 is earned by
**posting to ZUS Moments with the correct hashtags** — this is the only *numbered* bonus.

Beyond the numbers, the PDF also calls out extra bonus *actions* (not assigned a hard point
value, but officially encouraged — treat them as real bonuses on the page, without inventing
a figure):
- **Pace / Pace-Up:** literally listed as "◦ **Bonus:** Show your ZUS tumbler, cup, canned
  drink, or merch!"
- **Hydration:** "Show Your ZUS Spirit — use your ZUS tumbler or wear ZUS merch."
- **SnapFuel:** post with a **catchy title** (e.g. "Protein Power Bowl!").
- **Buddy Steps (W1–2):** the 40-pt tier explicitly requires "ZUS Moments **& tag your
  colleague**" — so tagging is a hard *condition* of the +10 here.
- FAQ Q14/Q15: ZUS Moments is optional; posting with correct hashtags earns the bonus.

So the booster's **quantified** weekly max is 40; merch/title are encouraged bonus actions
the PDF doesn't put a number on. In `data.js` these are split into two fields on the
W1-of-pair row: `bonus` = the +10 ZUS Moments line (bold), `extra` = the short un-numbered
nicety on its own line ("Show ZUS merch/tumbler", "Add a catchy title", "Add a fun caption",
"Tag a colleague (required for +10)").

## Bonus actionables (boosters only — not weigh-in/steps/workouts)
- 📣 **Post on ZUS Moments**: lifts a booster 30 → 40 pts. Tag #ChampionsFuelChampions + week's booster hashtag.
- 🥤 **Show ZUS merch**: in Pace/Hydration clips, feature tumbler/cup/canned drink/merch.
- 👥 **Tag colleagues**: on Buddy Steps, tag colleagues in the ZUS Moments post.

## Prizes
- **Individual:** 1st RM1,000 · 2nd RM700 · 3rd RM500 · 4th & 5th RM200.
- **Group (team of 2–5):** 1st RM5,000 · 2nd RM3,500 · 3rd RM1,500 · 4th & 5th RM1,000 (split equally per pax).
- Each participant joins **one** category only; no switching after registering.
- Weekly leaderboard; Top 5 individuals & Top 5 groups featured each week.

## Known issues in the source PDF (their typos, NOT ours — `data.js` is correct)
- Hydration Hustle (D) submission rule says "Week 5 & 6" — should be **Week 7 & 8**.

## Not yet reflected in the app (candidates)
- "Final Report: 28 Sep" date (sheet only).
- Prize amounts / leaderboard mechanics (intentionally out of scope — this is a timetable view).
